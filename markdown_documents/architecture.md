# Architecture Details 

1. ## Backend:

The Talkasurus backend is built with Python and Flask-SocketIO. Python’s flask, being a microframework, provides a minimal set of tools and libraries required to build a scalable web application.

The flask-socketio library provides a WebSocket protocol that works perfectly with react client of Talkasaurus, ensuring real-time two-way connection for natural human-like conversations.

Google’s Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs are used extensively for verbally communicating with the users. OpenAI’s GPT4-32K AI model is responsible for essential natural-like context-aware dialogues.

2. ## Frontend:

The frontend of this application is built around ReactJS, which is lightweight, efficient, and provides us with excellent tools to understand and trace how the state of the UI changes over time.

The Socket IO client embedded in our React application is used to facilitate real-time communication with the Flask-SocketIO backend. Our frontend uses the new react-audio-recorder to record user’s voice, which is then sent to the backend for processing.

The frontend and backend are connected via WebSockets.

3. ## Docker:

Docker containers help us maintain consistency across various individuals and instances covering all application processes and dependencies (including testing, developing, staging, and production phases, as well as across a team). The Docker file is configured to ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and machines.

4. ## Server: 

Our server, api_server.py, establishes a socket connection with our frontend, receives and emits audio data (and other necessary data), makes Web Api requests to Google and OpenAI services, and generally enables the entire application's flow and functioning.

5. ## Future Iterations: 

Future updates include plans to handle interruptions, the integration of microservices modules, adding more sophistication to bot characteristics and complexity and implementing a high state machine or Petri nets for conversation control.
