# Large Tasks and their Implementations

This file discusses the large tasks outlined in the README, such as:

- Future features like a Hierarchical State Machine or Petri Nets to handle complex conversation state transitions. A potential approach would involve setting up different stages in a conversation and managing state transitions based on user's input and AI's response.
[//]: # (TODO: add detail and improve)

- How the persona or speech pattern of the bot can be changable and reflective of the user's style which is being figured out simultaneously while interacting. (And to what extent local training is even necessary given how effective GPT-4 is at zero or few-shot learning) This would require further brainstorming and would have to strategically implement using GPT4
[//]: # (TODO: add detail and improve)

- plans to handle interruptions (when people talk over each other or cut each other off mid-sentence)
[//]: # (TODO: add detail and improve)

- Microservices or different modules: would likely be necessary in the future
[//]: # (TODO: add detail and improve)

- detail DevOpsBot, which should make bold plans for the development trajectory, while preserving human checkpoints, adjustments, suggestions, and changes
[//]: # (TODO: add detail and improve)

More detailed documentation on these tasks and others will be added as the project progresses.
