# Large Tasks and their Implementations

### Task #1: Excelling in Natural Conversation Flow
Our primary goal is an immersive natural conversation experience with users, including humans' spontaneity and fluidity.

Sub Tasks:
-    T1.a: Handling Interruptions and Interjections ([Issue Link 1a])
-    T1.b: Introducing Parallel Communication Threads ([Issue Link 1b])

Details: Simply put, interruptions and interjections are an integral part of human conversation. Manage these while maintaining the context to significantly enhance the conversation flow. 

Outcome: The app can handle interruptions and interjections to provide a smooth conversation experience.


### Task #2: Implementing Hierarchical State Machines or Petri Nets
We aim at extended state management to handle various flows in dialogue using Hierarchical State Machines (HSM) or Petri Nets.

Sub Tasks:
-    T2.a: Better Understand User's Input ([Issue Link 2a])
-    T2.b: Design Responses ([Issue Link 2b])
-    T2.c: Retain Context ([Issue Link 2c])

Details: To understand the user's input and context better, we will trend the AI response to be more suitable and synchronous with the conversation's previous flow and tone. 

Outcome: Better and contextually apt AI response system.


### Task #3: Advancement and Autonomy of DevOpsBot
To make TalkasaurusRex more autonomous and adaptive, we are developing a DevOpsBot that will propose and implement enhancements in speed, efficiency, and capabilities of TalkasaurusRex.

Sub Tasks:
-    T3.a: Idea Machine ([Issue Link 3a])
-    T3.b: Autonomous Code Debugging & Writing ([Issue Link 3b])
-    T3.c: Planning and Designing Workflows ([Issue Link 3c])
-    T3.d: Writing Test Cases ([Issue Link 3d])
-    T3.e: Software Telemetry Data Analysis ([Issue Link 3e])
-    T3.f: Enabling Human-in-the-Loop ([Issue Link 3f])

Details: The proposed DevOpsBot should be able to test, debug and rewrite code with no external assistance. It will significantly shorten the time needed to manage the issues and new enhancements to be made.

Outcome: An efficient and autonomous DevOpsBot that manages continuous improvements for TalkasaurusRex.

TODO: for every subtask, an issue link should be provided that details the problem, steps, period, and requirements to chalk out the solution to the task.
