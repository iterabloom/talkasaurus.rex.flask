# Large Tasks and their Implementations

This file discusses the large tasks outlined in the README, such as using a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) or Petri Nets to manage complex conversation state transitions and simultaneously processing different tasks. Further, it details ideas behind the implementation of the DevOpsBot, managing a balance between automated tasks such as deployments and checks requiring human intervention.

More detailed documentation on these tasks and others will be added as the project progresses.
