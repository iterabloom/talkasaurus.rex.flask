# Large Tasks and their Implementations

### Task #1: Excelling in Natural Conversation Flow
Our primary goal is an immersive natural conversation experience with users, including humans' spontaneity and fluidity.

Sub Tasks:
-    T1.a: Handling Interruptions and Interjections ([Issue Link 1a])
-    T1.b: Introducing Parallel Communication Threads ([Issue Link 1b])

Details: Simply put, interruptions and interjections are an integral part of human conversation. Manage these while maintaining the context to significantly enhance the conversation flow. 

Outcome: The app can handle interruptions and interjections to provide a smooth conversation experience.


### Task #2: Implementing Hierarchical State Machines or Petri Nets
We aim at extended state management to handle various flows in dialogue using Hierarchical State Machines (HSM) or Petri Nets.

Sub Tasks:
-    T2.a: Better Understand User's Input ([Issue Link 2a])
-    T2.b: Design Responses ([Issue Link 2b])
-    T2.c: Retain Context ([Issue Link 2c])

Details: To understand the user's input and context better, we will trend the AI response to be more suitable and synchronous with the conversation's previous flow and tone. 

Outcome: Better and contextually apt AI response system.


### Task #3: Advancement and Autonomy of DevOpsBot
To make TalkasaurusRex more autonomous and adaptive, we are developing a DevOpsBot that will propose and implement enhancements in speed, efficiency, and capabilities of TalkasaurusRex.

Sub Tasks:
-    T3.a: Idea Machine ([Issue Link 3a])
-    T3.b: Autonomous Code Debugging & Writing ([Issue Link 3b])
-    T3.c: Planning and Designing Workflows ([Issue Link 3c])
-    T3.d: Writing Test Cases ([Issue Link 3d])
-    T3.e: Software Telemetry Data Analysis ([Issue Link 3e])
-    T3.f: Enabling Human-in-the-Loop ([Issue Link 3f])

Details: The proposed DevOpsBot should be able to test, debug and rewrite code with no external assistance. It will significantly shorten the time needed to manage the issues and new enhancements to be made.

Outcome: An efficient and autonomous DevOpsBot that manages continuous improvements for TalkasaurusRex.


### Task #4: Easy export and instant text search of transcribed conversation history
TODO: rewrite this as sub tasks, as the above Tasks are
The front end should make it easy for the user to visually browse through their entire conversation history, or do text searches with regular expressions, or perform advanced queries of the metadata. Since conversations can be wide-ranging over many topics, transcripts should include metadata that note when a change of subject is detected - thereby enabling every transcript to be presented, if desired, as a linear sequence of subject-specific tiles. This architecture would enable a user to find every time the conversation was about polar bears (for example). There should also be an option to "clean up" transcripts, i.e. remove the various technical symbols used by discourse transcription researchers, such as indications of speech overlap, transitional continuity, terminal pitch direction, accent, and lengthening -- so as to make them easier to read (while separately preserving the delicate/detailed transcript). Finally, export options should include the delicate transcript, the reader-friendly transcript, transcripts with subject/topic and other metadata, and search results of any query. Transcript exports should be easily made in bulk to either separate plain-text files or a single such file, and search result exports should be CSV- or ODF-formatted. Import functionality might also be interesting.

TODO: for every subtask, an issue link should be provided that details the problem, steps, period, and requirements to chalk out the solution to the task.
