# Large Tasks and their Implementations

This file discusses the large tasks outlined in the README, such as:

- Future features like a Hierarchical State Machine or Petri Nets to handle complex conversation state transitions. A key goal here is to mimic the natural flow of human conversation, which often involves back-and-forths, tangents, and resumptions of topics. As such, it is necessary to keep a "memory" or context of what the user said earlier. A Hierarchical State Machine and Petri Nets can provide an elegant solution to this problem. 

- How the persona or speech pattern of the bot can be changeable and reflective of the user's style, which is being figured out simultaneously while interacting. For this task, we plan on implementing a user-feedback loop that will allow the AI to adapt and mirror a user's unique style over the course of a conversation. This will involve implementing a data processing pipeline that can parse, classify, and provide useful insights from a user's text input.

- Plans to handle interruptions (when people talk over each other or cut each other off mid-sentence). For this, we can provide a UI feature for the user to purposely interject and redirect the conversation. This will also involve developing an understanding and modeling of turn-taking in conversations.

- Microservices or different modules: would likely be necessary in the future. Considering the different components in our application (speech-to-text, text-to-AI interface, AI-to-text-to-speech), different modules will allow development to take place in parallel, improving scalability, readability, and maintainability.

- Detail DevOpsBot, which should make bold plans for the development trajectory, while preserving human checkpoints, adjustments, suggestions, and changes. This involves setting up a number of automated scripts and tools to help maintain the repository and automate common tasks like code testing, deployment, and generating novel, useful, nonobvious feature ideas and then implementing those ideas as code.

More detailed documentation on these tasks and others will be added as the project progresses.
