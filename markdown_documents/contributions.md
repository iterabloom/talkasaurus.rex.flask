# Contribution Guidelines

We deeply value your interest and appreciate your contributions to TalkasaurusRex. We have a few guidelines for you to follow in order to maintain code quality, functionality, and readability:

- **Branching Policy:** Always work on a new feature or bug in separate branches off of `main`. Naming of branches should be descriptive of the feature or bug that is being worked on.

- **Code Quality:** Ensure code written follows best practices. Concentrate on factoring, naming variables and functions descriptively, and aim for minimalism and simplicity.

- **Testing:** Before creating a pull request, make sure your code doesnâ€™t break anything in the project. Test your changes adequately.

- **Pull Requests:** Stick to one feature or bug per pull request. While creating a pull request, provide a detailed overview of the change being introduced.

- **Code Merge:** Code is merged into the `main` branch only after the code review process is complete. Please be patient; this project has minimal resources (of the human variety) allocated to it.

Note: It is okay to submit a pull request for a feature or bug-fix even if it's not complete. This gives everyone an opportunity to review your work and participate.
