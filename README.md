TalkasaurusRex is designed for naturally flowing conversation - adapting and mirroring the user's communication style. It leverages Google's Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech APIs, alongside the GPT4-32k model, creating an interaction akin to conversing with another human.

## Features
- Gestures like Interjections, Nonword Vocalizations: The app can catch and react appropriately to "ummm", "hmm", "ah", and pauses in conversation to create a very human-like interaction.
- Adapting To User Style: It aims to mirror or complement the user's diction, imagery, language, syntax, and conversational patterns.
- Hierarchical State Machine (HSM): Intended for complex conversation and state management; plans are to use Petri nets for task parallelism.
- DevOpsBot: A presence within the system for improvements, featuring mechanisms for human-in-the-loop interventions when complexity rises, for instance deploying a segment of code marked with `[manual_review]`.
