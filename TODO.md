# TODO for overall project
- add config file(s) for GitHub Actions, the CI/CD pipeline management tool 
- set up automated testing reports and build notifications
- do the 'TODO' comments in the individual code files
- follow standard best practices for Python and JavaScript, including readability, testability, efficiency, and simplicity, to make code more robust and maintainable
- ensure comprehensive documentation/markdown files in the repository to help future contributors understand the application and its architecture better, and make enhancements accordingly
    - create separate markdown documents in the root directory of the application for larger tasks
    - use inline comments for smaller bits of code
- for optimization and better management, consider segregating different features or Tensor tasks into microservices or different modules
