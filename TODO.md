# TODO for overall project
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive documentation/markdown files in the repository to help future contributors understand the application and its architecture better, and make enhancements accordingly
- [ ] keep the big picture in mind, and keep brainstorming it, planning it, and implementing it - use iteration of markdown_documents/large_tasks.md as a jumping-off point.
- [ ] Create a markdown document for each large task under the `markdown_documents` directory
- [ ] Make efficient use of inline comments in the code-base to understand code functionality at micro level
